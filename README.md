# JishoNotes API
This is part of the service used by me to do notes searching for a great 
English-Japanese dictionary app which can be found on the App Store 
called "ShirabeJisho" (ps. not advertisement; I just love using it).

As the project grows, the functionality of JishoNotes API increases as 
well.

## Basic Features
- Notes searching
- Flashcard packs
- Simple Japanese Dictionary
- Japanese Sentence Analyzing

## Personal Notes
Though the project is being touted as "big" on my personal webpage, I 
did not think I will upload this to GitHub that early.

Since this is a major project for me to learn the Spring Framework, 
the project source code is unnecessarily verbose. You can see lots of 
comments with links posted here and there. This is my only way of 
appreciating those who helped me out.

## External Components
These components do not have their index, schema or source posted on 
GitHub. Maybe I will do it in the future.
- PostgreSQL
- ElasticSearch
- Front-end application (VueJS)
